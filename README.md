Arduino controller for Babylonjs
================================

Project with my son messing around with the Arduino as a game controller.

- Uses very cheap combined accelerometer and gyroscope (Â£3)

- Arduino sketch polls accelerometer and writes JSON info to serial port

- Serial API in Chrome (packaged app) sends data to game window

- We are using Blender to create models, exported to .babylon format

- You can fly the model around using Arduino

Ultimate aim is to have dragon breath fire and make some kind of game.
